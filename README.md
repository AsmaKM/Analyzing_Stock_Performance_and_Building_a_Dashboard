Python Project for Data Science
About This Project
This project simulates a real-world scenario where I play the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working at a startup investment firm. The goal is to help customers make informed investment decisions by analyzing the performance of popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

Using Python, I extracted financial data like historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports through web scraping and APIs. I then visualized this data in an interactive dashboard to identify trends and patterns.

This project demonstrates key data science skills, including:

Data extraction using web scraping and APIs

Data analysis with Pandas

Data visualization using Plotly

Working in a Jupyter Notebook environment

ðŸ§  What I Learned
Applying Python fundamentals and data structures to real-world data

Using BeautifulSoup for web scraping HTML tables
